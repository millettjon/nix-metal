Setup test environment to replicate nixos install from OVH rescue CD.

Use qemu to boot into rescuecd distro.
- https://www.system-rescue-cd.org/

SUMMARY
Install nixos on a bare metal system.

TASKS
- use tmp/ instead of var/
- get running locally
- factor out into namespaces
- add partitioning configuration suitable for laptop
  -? how does it get configuration?
    -? auto detect?
- launch nix installer
  -? how does it get configuration?

QUESTIONS
- ? what would final process look like?
  ssh newbox
  git clone ... (or scp -r from local box)
  bin/install
- ? how does luks password get managed?
- ? luks key should be generated on device? (is this too slow in vm?)

ARCHITECTURE
- assumes system is:
  - booted using rescue cd
  - can be connected to via ssh (or console)
  - has network access to download

GOALS
- should work on servers
- should work on laptops
- should handle partitioning
- should handle zfs
- should handle raid
- should handle zfs & raid
- should handle swap
- should have some auto detection capability
- should handle full disk encryption (LUKS)

NICE TO HAVE
- for servers: dropbear ssh in initrd for remote unlock
- for laptops: unlock w/ secure password at boot
- for laptops: unlock w/ security toke at boot
